            <p>Pheasant Apiary is the third in the Birds of Paradise series featuring a variety of feathered friends in unfamiliar territories.</p>

            <p>Each piece was inspired by a vacation destination and aims to capture the spirit of exploration with the awareness of being an outsider.d.
            </p>

            <p>This piece features a pheasant standing on top of colorfully painted apiary boxes. The painting was inspired by a trip to Hawaii where my wife and I visited a local apiary on Kauai. The stalks of sugar cane conjured images of traditional pheasant paintings in which the birds populate their native northern regions of the americas.
            </p>

            <p>The original concept was meant to feature a rooster, a state protected species. The roosters provide a unique spectacle often behaving like crows diving into garbage cans and strutting down the street looking for scraps.  I felt the pheasant brought a different feel and helped provide the same contrast Cadillac Bay and Light Catcher produced. </p>
